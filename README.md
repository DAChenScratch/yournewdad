## battlesnake-go

This snake runs on google cloud

to run locally with the docker container you have to specify that the **-host** is your local ip

i.e. 

goapp serve -host=192.168.0.33

## TODO

guess where the snakes are going
make moves to trap other snakes
account for tail movement
predict 1 move ahead
