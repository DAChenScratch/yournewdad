## battlesnake-go

This snake runs on google cloud

to run locally with the docker container you have to specify that the **-host** is your local ip

i.e. 

goapp serve -host=192.168.0.33

## TODO

make filters file
make test for death by other snakes
guess where the snakes are going
efficiently use space when you are getting larger
get aggressive when you are large
make moves to trap other snakes
account for tail movement
